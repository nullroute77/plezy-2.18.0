// A native Wayland video plane: a wl_subsurface stacked *below* the Flutter
// toplevel surface, carrying its own EGL window surface that mpv renders into
// directly.
//
// This is the Linux analogue of the Windows video child HWND. Flutter's own
// surface keeps the UI and alpha-blends over this one, so video never travels
// through Flutter's compositor — which on GTK3 costs one CPU-side upload of the
// whole window surface per presented frame (see gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl's
// alpha path), previously paid once per *video* frame.
//
// Everything here runs on the GTK main thread, with one deliberate exception:
// the commit itself. PreparePresent()/CompletePresent() bracket an
// eglSwapBuffers that the plugin performs on the plane render thread (issue
// #2057: an expensive render on the main thread starves input dispatch and
// Flutter's raster). All Wayland protocol state stays main-thread; the worker
// only ever touches the EGL surface. The subsurface is desynchronized
// so its commits are independent of the parent's frame loop; position and
// stacking, however, are *parent* state and only take effect on a parent
// commit, which is why SetRect() asks the view to redraw.
//
// mpv is never told about Wayland: it only ever sees the EGL surface's default
// framebuffer. Embedding mpv into a foreign Wayland surface is not possible
// (mpv's --wid does not work on Wayland and upstream considers it out of
// scope), so the app owns the subsurface and drives the render itself.
