# Swap the flutter-plezy custom Windows engine into the Flutter SDK's artifact
# cache (or restore stock). See flutter-plezy's README for how the artifacts
# are built.
#
# The flutter tool validates the cache by stamp STRING only (no file hashing),
# so swapped files stick - but `flutter upgrade` / `flutter precache --force`
# silently restore stock; re-run this script afterwards.
#
# Usage:
#   swap-engine.ps1 -Mode debug   -Zip C:\path\to\windows-x64-flutter.zip
#   swap-engine.ps1 -Mode release -Zip ...
#   swap-engine.ps1 -Mode debug -Restore
