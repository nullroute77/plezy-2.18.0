"""Guard the generated MSIX manifest behind Microsoft Store submissions.

windows/build-msix.ps1 generates AppxManifest.xml per architecture at package
time, so there is no manifest in the tree to review. These checks read the
script as text and validate the template it returns - they never invoke
PowerShell, because root CI runs on Linux where pwsh cannot be assumed, and
-EmitManifestOnly is the Windows-side developer loop instead.

The invariants pinned here are the ones makeappx, the shell and Store
certification enforce: the schema's fixed child order, identity strings that
satisfy their pattern constraints and match the reserved product, a four-part
version whose revision field is the 0 the Store reserves, one template shared by
both architectures, assets that actually exist in the tree, and the resource
index without which the unplated taskbar icons never resolve.
