"""Behavior tests for the bundle host dependency guard.

The nested-module case reproduces the bug that motivated them: bundle-libs.sh
installs the dlopen'd gdk-pixbuf loaders and GIO modules into lib/
subdirectories, and the guard scanned lib/*.so* only - so those modules counted
as bundled while their own host dependencies never reached ldd, and the check
reported success over exactly the undeclared library it exists to catch.

ldd and dpkg-query only answer on a Debian-family machine, so the checker
resolves both through PLEZY_HOST_TOOLS and the fixtures here install stubs
there. That keeps "a bundle that needs libpng16" a fixture rather than a
machine, and keeps the tests exercising the real script end to end.
