/// Shared scaffold for the four Linux HDR startup cases.
///
/// Each lives in its own file with one test, because a second `VideoPlayerScreen`
/// in the same isolate never reaches `initialize`. Measured, repeatedly: the
/// second test's wait fails with `calls=[isModeChanged, isHDRChanged,
/// setVideoRect]` and no `initialize` among them, so nothing the HDR block does
/// can be observed.
///
/// Partly explained, and the gap is worth knowing before you retry. `PlayerBase`
/// keeps one event-channel owner at a time; a successor built before the
/// predecessor's release settles inherits that future, and `PlayerBase.invoke`
/// awaits it before touching the channel, returning null on timeout rather than
/// calling (player_base.dart:1035-1041). That accounts for the missing
/// `initialize`, and for `isModeChanged`/`isHDRChanged` arriving anyway since
/// DisplayModeService drives the channel directly. It does *not* account for
/// `setVideoRect`, which goes through the same gate and still lands - so the
/// picture is incomplete and that is the loose end to pull on.
///
/// Two remedies were measured and neither works. Shortening
/// `debugNativeOwnershipDisposeTimeout` only makes `invoke` give up sooner, which
/// is still a dropped call; at its 3 s default it outlasts [pumpUntil]'s 2 s
/// budget, so the wait fails first. Draining the predecessor's `dispose`/`cancel`
/// does not help either - the owner entry clears a microtask after those calls
