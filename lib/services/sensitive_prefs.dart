/// Preference keys whose stored values are credentials.
///
/// `shared_preferences` is the most credential-dense artifact in a Plezy
/// installation. On the desktop platforms it is a single plaintext JSON file
/// next to the database, and it holds:
///
/// * [credentialVaultKeyPref] — the AES-256 key that `CredentialVault` uses to
///   protect every server/profile token stored in the Drift
///   `connections.config_json` and `profile_connections.user_token` columns.
///   Losing it orphans every one of those ciphertexts permanently.
/// * tracker sessions — `TrackerAccountStore` persists `TrackerSession.encode()`
///   verbatim, so raw OAuth `access_token`/`refresh_token` pairs for MAL,
///   AniList, Simkl, Trakt and MDBList live here in plaintext.
/// * Seerr sessions — `SeerrSessionStore` persists a raw `connect.sid` cookie
///   alongside a vault-protected password.
/// * [legacyPlexTokenPref] — the pre-connection-registry Plex token slot. It is
///   drained by the connection migration but can linger on old installs.
///
/// Two subsystems consult this list, both added for #1732:
///
/// * the tolerant preference reads in `BaseSharedPreferencesService` must never
///   silently drop one of these keys — an unreadable credential has to surface
///   as an explicit repair prompt, not as a silent re-authentication;
/// * the corrupt-store repair in `PrefsRecovery` salvages exactly these keys
///   out of a damaged store before quarantining it.
///
/// Keep this list exhaustive. A credential slot that is missing here is
/// silently dropped on a type mismatch and silently lost on a repair.
///
/// This lives apart from `CredentialVault`, `TrackerAccountStore` and
/// `SeerrSessionStore` so `BaseSharedPreferencesService` can depend on it
/// without an import cycle.
