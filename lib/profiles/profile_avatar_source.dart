///
/// A [LocalProfile] has no picture of its own. It shows the user picture of
/// the connection it was linked to **first** — the oldest by
/// [Connection.createdAt], ties broken by connection id so the choice is
/// stable. If that connection has no picture the profile falls back to
/// initials; we deliberately do *not* skip ahead to a later connection, so the
/// avatar stays a property of "the first connection" rather than of whichever
/// backend happens to have an image today.

/// The join row is not a usable ordering key: `profile_connections` has no
/// creation timestamp, and `tokenAcquiredAt` is rewritten every time the
/// binder re-mints a Plex Home token.
