/**
 * Reads Android Automotive OS driver-distraction state straight from the platform.
 *
 * Plezy previously derived "may audio play?" from the Flutter activity lifecycle, which conflates
 * two different things: a car that is driving, and a car that is parked with Plezy simply not in
 * the foreground. Only the first must silence playback (car app quality `DD-2`/`DD-3`); the second
 * is ordinary background audio. [CarUxRestrictionsManager] is the signal the platform documents for
 * apps where lifecycle reaction is not sufficient.
 *
 * Bound explicitly to [Display.DEFAULT_DISPLAY] — the driver's screen — by creating a display
 * context for it. An application context would NOT do: it has no associated display, so
 * `CarUxRestrictionsManager` falls back to the current user's assigned main display, which under
 * multi-user Android Automotive OS can be a passenger screen. UX restrictions legitimately differ
 * per display, but audio is not per-display, and `DD-2` requires audio to stop when the user starts
 * driving unless the device declares `com.android.car.background_audio_while_driving`. Reading the
 * driver display therefore keeps a passenger-display session stricter than it may need to be, which
 * is the safe direction; do not rebind this without pairing it with that feature check. If the
 * default display cannot be resolved, [start] fails closed and the caller keeps lifecycle gating.
 *
 * Connection uses the [Car.CarServiceLifecycleListener] overload with
 * [Car.CAR_WAIT_TIMEOUT_DO_NOT_WAIT], which is not a preference:
 *
 *  - `Car.createCar(Context)` blocks the calling thread polling for the car service (AOSP polls
 *    every 50 ms up to 100 times, so up to five seconds) and is reached from the main thread here.
 *  - Worse, a client created without a lifecycle listener is terminated when the car service dies:
 *    the library calls `finishClient()`, which for anything that is not literally an `Activity` or
 *    `Service` — a display context included — runs `Process.killProcess(myPid())`. A routine car
 *    service update would take the whole app down.
 *
 * With the listener, `createCar` never blocks and a service restart arrives as `ready = false`
 * instead. Every `ready = true` re-fetches the manager and re-registers the listener, because the
 * old manager holds a dead binder: its calls then return null and are swallowed, which would look
 * like a permanently parked car rather than a failure.
 *
 * `android.car` is a platform library that only exists on Android Automotive OS images, hence the
 * `useLibrary` compile-time stub, the `uses-library required=false` manifest entry, and the
 * defensive [Throwable] catches: on a phone the classes are simply absent.
